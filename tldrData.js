      "I built an active aerobrake system that controlled the rocketâ€™s ascent. The system actively predicts the rocket's apogee. If this is higher than the goal apogee, the system deploys three fins to increase the surface area of the rocket. This increases the drag, decreasing the projected apogee.",
